  "about": "I’m an master science engineering student with focus on interaction technology & design currently doing my 4th term at Umeå University. The important thing about UI/UX design in my opinion is not just knowing how to make a visually appealing shell but it’s knowing how to design based on user data and why your design decisions should be as they are. A good idea needs a well executed design."
